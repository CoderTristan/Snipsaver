SnipSaver is a sleek, minimal code snippet manager designed for developers who want to save, tag, and search their most useful code fragments easily. It features syntax highlighting, smart organization with tags and folders, and lightning-fast search. Users can save snippets via a browser extension or VS Code plugin and access them from anywhere. The Pro version includes cloud sync, team collaboration, and AI-powered snippet explanations. It’s like Notion for code — but faster, cleaner, and built just for devs.

mart Tag Suggestions
When saving a snippet, the app suggests relevant tags automatically based on snippet content or language.

Helps users organize without extra thinking.

Could be a simple keyword extractor or small AI model.

2. Snippet Search with Filters
Add quick filters by language, tag, date saved.

Keep search bar simple but powerful for fast snippet retrieval.

3. Snippet Versioning
Allow users to save new versions of a snippet without cluttering the main list.

Useful when tweaking or improving code snippets.

4. Copy with Formatting
One-click copy that preserves indentation and syntax highlighting for pasting into IDEs or markdown files.

Simple UX improvement.

5. Snippet Preview or “Run”
For some languages (like JavaScript or Python), a safe sandbox to quickly run and preview output of snippets.

Optional but can be lightweight (like embedding a REPL iframe or using a minimal serverless function).

6. Quick Snippet Export
Export selected snippets to markdown, JSON, or plain text file.

Handy for backups or sharing with teammates.

7. Dark Mode
Simple UI toggle for eye comfort — very appreciated by devs.

8. Browser Extension or VS Code Plugin (MVP)
Minimal versions that let users save snippets from anywhere or directly inside VS Code.

Drives engagement without changing core UI.
